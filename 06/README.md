# Project 06: The Assembler

I am going to implement the assembler using C++.

This project is organized as follows:
- `Test-Programs`: `.asm` programs provided by the course.
- `AssemblerL`: Contains implementation of the first stage of the assembler. This assembler translates assembly programs that **do not** contain symbols (Assembler Less Symbols).
- `Assembler`: Phase two implementation. This assembler translates assembly programs that **do** contain symbols.
- `AssemblerB`: (Extra) The previous assemblers translate Hack assembly code to a text file with the characters `0`, `1`, and the newline character only. This assembler translate the Hack assembly code to an actual binary file.

Open the Hack Assembler solution in Visual Studio 2019 to view each project in detail.
