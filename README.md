In the Introduction to Logic class by Florida Atlantic University, students have to complete the first part of the book "The Elements of Computing Systems." That is projects 1–6.

This repository contains the projects completed by me. After the class, I continued to complete projects 7–12. Therefore, this repository is **not open for contributions**. It is only for sharing my results.

Projects 01-05 do not contain a README file. These folders only include the files I turned in for the class; those are only the HDL (and ASM files in the case of 05) assigned for the respective projects. From project 06 onward, I started documenting my progress using git, and I also added README files that explain some details of each project and my approach (in some cases).

Thank you, Dr. Schocken and Dr. Nisan, for creating this course. In addition to teaching me a lot, it has inspired me to go above and beyond in my projects.
