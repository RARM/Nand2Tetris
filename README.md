# Nand2Tetris
In the Introduction to Logic class at [Florida Atlantic University](https://www.fau.edu/), students have to complete the first part of the book "The Elements of Computing Systems." That is projects 1–6.

This repository contains the projects completed by me, and _I am continuing_ to complete projects 7–12. Therefore, this repository is **not open for contributions**. It is only to keep a portfolio.

Projects 01-05 do not contain a README file. These folders include only the HDL (and ASM in the case of 05) files. From project 06 onward, I started documenting my progress using git, and I also added README files that explain some details of each project and my approach (in some cases). I will try to add more information and organize the repository as I keep going.

Thank you, Dr. Schocken and Dr. Nisan, for creating this course and sharing it freely online. In addition to teaching me a lot, it has inspired me to go above and beyond in my projects.

Thank you, Dr. Ilyas for using "The Elements of Computing Systems" in our class, caring for your students, and going above and beyond answering questions after class (even those that went beyond the scope of the class).
