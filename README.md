In the Introduction to Logic class by Florida Atlantic University, students have to complete the first part of the book "The Elements of Computing Systems." That is projects 1–6.

This repository contains the projects completed by me. After the class, I continued to complete projects 7–12. Therefore, this repository is **not open for contributions**. It is only for sharing my results.

Thank you, Dr. Schocken and Dr. Nisan, for creating this course. In addition to teaching me a lot, it has inspired me to go above and beyond in my projects.
